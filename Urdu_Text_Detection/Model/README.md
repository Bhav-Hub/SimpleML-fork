# Urdu Text Detection

## Aim
Create a DL model which will identify the texts written in Urdu.

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maryambiibii/urdu-artificial-text-text-detection


## Mindset
This model can be created effectively using r-CNN, faster r-CNN, EAST or YOLO models without the need for creating our own.

## Libraries and Frameworks used
* `Numpy` - for array manipulations and calculations
* `Pandas` - for dealing with dataframe and training and test sets.
* `Matplotlib` - for plotting graphs and images
* `cv2` (OpenCV) - for manipulating images
* `Pillow` - for viewing images
* `tensorflow` & `keras` - for implementing Deep Learning Models
